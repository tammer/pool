problem: NewGame has no field named 'week'
solution: had changed field name in one place and not another



from pool.models import Team,Game,Pick,PickSheet
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
x = Pick(player=User.objects.first(), game = Game.objects.filter(week_number=1, game_number=1).first(), picked_fav=False)
ps = PickSheet(player=User.objects.first(), mntp = 44)
